## Built-in optimizations

1. Next.js comes with built-in optimizations like code splitting, image optimization, and server-side rendering to improve the performance of your application.
2. Code splitting allows you to split your code into smaller chunks that are loaded only when needed, reducing the initial load time of your application.
3. Image optimization automatically optimizes images by resizing and compressing them to reduce the file size and improve the performance of your application.
4. Server-side rendering allows you to generate HTML on the server and send it to the client, reducing the time to first paint and improving SEO.

```javascript
// pages/index.js
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js</h1>
      <Image src="/image.jpg" alt="Next.js" width={500} height={500} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Dynamic HTML Streaming

1. Next.js supports dynamic HTML streaming, which allows you to stream HTML content to the client as it is being generated on the server.
2. This feature improves the time to first byte (TTFB) and time to first paint (TTFP) of your application, providing a better user experience.
3. Dynamic HTML streaming is particularly useful for pages with large amounts of content or data that take time to generate on the server.

```javascript
// pages/index.js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const data = await fetchData()
  return {
    props: { data }
  }
}

export default function Home({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {data.map(item => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## React Server Components

1. Next.js introduces React Server Components, a new feature that allows you to offload server-side rendering to the server while keeping the interactivity of client-side rendering.
2. React Server Components enable you to fetch data, perform server-side computations, and render components on the server, improving the performance and SEO of your application.
3. This feature allows you to build dynamic and interactive applications that are fast and SEO-friendly.

```javascript
// components/ServerComponent.js
import { ServerComponent } from 'next/server'

export default function MyServerComponent() {
  return (
    <ServerComponent>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js</h1>
    </ServerComponent>
  )
}
```
<hr />

## Data Fetching

1. Next.js provides multiple ways to fetch data, including `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and `getInitialProps`, to fetch data at build time, request time, or both.
2. `getStaticProps` allows you to fetch data at build time and generate static HTML pages, improving the performance of your application.
3. `getServerSideProps` fetches data on each request, allowing you to generate dynamic content based on the user's request.
4. `getInitialProps` is an older method that fetches data on the server or client, depending on the page's context.

```javascript
// pages/index.js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData()
  return {
    props: { data }
  }
}

export default function Home({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {data.map(item => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```
